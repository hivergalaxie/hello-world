# hello-world

Hello,

I'm Aster, 14, and just coding as a hobby because I have nothing else to do apparently.

I love K-pop, space stuffs, and cold stuffs. I'm a ONCE but I don't really "involve" myself into the K-pop community like streaming or whatnot, I just like the music :p.

Nice to meet you all~
